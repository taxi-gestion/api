## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Distributed version control system for a set of files
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/): Runtime environment for Javascript

> Node can be installed via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), which allows you to quickly get and use different versions of Node via the command line.

## Installation

Clone the project

### Setting up the prerequisites

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

These commands are used in the context of application development and should be run from the root of the workspace.

### Launch the local API server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start-local
```

### Database for local development

Common development commands are found in the scripts field of package.json
The API relies on a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database service which can be set up locally on docker.

Docker one-liner
To set up a blank database for testing

```bash
docker run -d \
--name postgres \
--rm \
--shm-size=512m \
-p 5432:5432 \
-e POSTGRES_DB=database \
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
-v "$(pwd)/docker-data/postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/data" \
postgres:14.6
```

Testing

```shell
‚ùØ curl  http://0.0.0.0:3000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ÓÇ≤ 1.64 ÔÇÄ ÓÇ≥ 14,6G ÔÉ§ ÓÇ≥ 0,B Ôë§ ÓÇ≥ 100% Ôï∏
OK
```

Without a database

```shell
